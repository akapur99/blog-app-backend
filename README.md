## Abhimanyu Kapur


### Description
* A fun and ~ simple ~ blog CRUD web app server to be used by anyone!!!

### What Worked (or Didn't)
* Got a much better understanding of redux and life cycle, and flow of control
* Planning components in advance and keeping it simple was helpful
* What didn't work was my understanding of the schema model initially

### Extra Credit
* Only author of post can edit/delete it
* Styling - Using React Material Ui
